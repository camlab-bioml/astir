``astir`` is a modelling framework for the assignment of cell type and cell state across a range of single-cell technologies such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). ``astir`` is built using `pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and uses recognition networks for fast minibatch stochastic variational inference.
